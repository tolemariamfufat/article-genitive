Abstract


In this paper, I describe Afaan Oromoo Genitive Construction. In Afaan Oromoo, genitive constructions are marked by lengthening a final vowel of a noun. A noun that got its vowel long is interpreted as the possessor a noun that precedes it. The interpretation of Afaan Oromoo genitive construction where two nouns are involved is straightforward; but, if more than two nouns are involved ambiguities arise. This means that if a genitive construction is formed by three nouns, the second noun can be interpreted either as possessor (concerning the preceding noun) or as the possessed noun (concerning the following noun). I hypothesize that a genitive construction that involves more than two nouns is a borrowed instance that lacks an established phrasal pattern. These ambiguities are the source of public arguments. In the first part of this paper, I shall discuss problem areas of the topic by citing examples from social media. Moreover, I shall discuss more complex examples of Afaan Oromoo genitive constructions by citing sample MA thesis titles. In the second part, I shall discuss literature reviews on Afaan Oromoo genitive construction. The third part proposes solutions and concludes the paper. 

There are  5 types of genitive construction. These are possessive, subjective, source, objective and descritptive (https://www.eltconcourse.com/training/inservice/lexicogrammar/genitive.html). 

1. Possessive
Possessive genitive can be expressed either morphologically or syntactically. For example, 
1a. mana Tolasaa
1b. Tolasaan mana qaba
2a. obboleessa Boontuu
2b. Boontuun obboleessa qabdi.
The above examples are possessive genitives. They are expressed morphologically and syntactically. These are known as alienable genitive constructions. As compared to these genitives, an inalienable genitives cannot expresseed morphologically. For example,

3a. Gaaddiseen refeensa dheeraa qabdi.
3b. *rifeensa dheeraa Gaaddisee
4a. Waariyoon ilkaan kaarruu qaba
4b. *ilkaan kaarruu Waariyoo

2. The subjective genitive
The subjective genitive expresses about the nature of the subject of a sentence. It doesn’t refer to possession. The subjective genitive can be expressed morophologically as well as syntactically as shown below:

5a. Fayyisaan aare.
5b. aarii Fayyisaa
6a. Qananiisaan fiige
6b. fiigicha Qananiisaa

3. Source/Origin
Source genitive refers to the origin of a noun. For example, 

7a. buna Wallaggaa
7b. *Wallagga buna qaba
8a. murtee ummataa
8b. *Ummatni murtee qaba.

4. The objective genitive
The objejective genitive refers to the nature of the object of a sentence. This type of genive construction can be expressed morophologically as well as syntactically as shown below:

9a. nama gargaare
9b. gargaarsa namaa
10a. Mana ijaare
10b. Ijaarsa manaa

5. The Descriptive genitive
11. Digrii Lammaffaa
12. Gulantaa lammaffaa
13. Itti aanaa Ministeeraa
Akkuma armaan olitti argamu kana, (11) akaakuu digirii ibsa, (12) ammoo akaakuu gulantaa yoo ibsu (13) ammoo sadarkaa aangoo ibsa.
