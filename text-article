Abstract


In this paper, I describe Afaan Oromoo Genitive Construction. In Afaan Oromoo, genitive constructions are marked by lengthening a final vowel of a noun. A noun that got its vowel long is interpreted as the possessor a noun that precedes it. The interpretation of Afaan Oromoo genitive construction where two nouns are involved is straightforward; but, if more than two nouns are involved ambiguities arise. This means that if a genitive construction is formed by three nouns, the second noun can be interpreted either as possessor (concerning the preceding noun) or as the possessed noun (concerning the following noun). I hypothesize that a genitive construction that involves more than two nouns is a borrowed instance that lacks an established phrasal pattern. These ambiguities are the source of public arguments. In the first part of this paper, I shall discuss problem areas of the topic by citing examples from social media. Moreover, I shall discuss more complex examples of Afaan Oromoo genitive constructions by citing sample MA thesis titles. In the second part, I shall discuss literature reviews on Afaan Oromoo genitive construction. The third part proposes solutions and concludes the paper. 

There are  5 types of genitive construction. These are possessive, subjective, source, objective and descritptive (https://www.eltconcourse.com/training/inservice/lexicogrammar/genitive.html). 

1. Possessive
Possessive genitive can be expressed either morphologically or syntactically. For example, 
1a. mana Tolasaa
1b. Tolasaan mana qaba
2a. obboleessa Boontuu
2b. Boontuun obboleessa qabdi.
The above examples are possessive genitives. They are expressed morphologically and syntactically. 

2. Alienable genitive

Alienable genitive constructions are expressed sysntactically. These genitive constructions show possession. Possessive genitives are alienable genitives.

3. Inalienable genitive

Inlienable genitives are possessive cases which can be expressed morphologically. As compared to these genitives, an inalienable genitives cannot expresseed morphologically. For example,

3a. Gaaddiseen refeensa dheeraa qabdi.
3b. *rifeensa dheeraa Gaaddisee
4a. Waariyoon ilkaan kaarruu qaba
4b. *ilkaan kaarruu Waariyoo

4. The subjective genitive
The subjective genitive expresses about the nature of the subject of a sentence. It doesn’t refer to possession. The subjective genitive can be expressed morophologically as well as syntactically as shown below:

5a. Fayyisaan aare.
5b. aarii Fayyisaa
6a. Qananiisaan fiige
6b. fiigicha Qananiisaa
7a. Tolasaan mana ijaare.
7b. Mana ijaarsa Tolasaa
8a. Giiloon muka yaabe
8b. Muka yaabbii Giiloo


9a. Boontuun boqqolloo cabsite.
9b. Boqqolloo cabsaa Boontuu

5. Source/Origin
Source genitive refers to the origin of a noun. Source genitives can be expressed both morphologically as well as syntactically. 

7a. buna Wallaggaa
7b. Wallagga buna biqilcha
8a. murtee ummataa
8b. ummatni murtee murteessa.

6. Objective genitive
Ojejective genitive refers to the nature of the object of a sentence. This type of genive construction can be expressed morophologically as well as syntactically as shown below:

9a. Tulluun mana ijaare
9b. ijaarsa manaa
10a. Galgaloon boqqoloo cabse
10b. Cabsaa boqqolloo

5. The Descriptive genitive

Rosenbach, A. (2006). Descriptive genitives in English: a case study on constructional gradience. English Language & Linguistics, 10(1), 77-118.
 (https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/english-language-and-linguistics/article/descriptive-genitives-in-english-a-case-study-on-constructional-gradience/7B0AD52F3E002B99300A2EE9E805577B)

1. how do descriptive genitives differ from possessive genitives?
2. Are descriptive genitives syntactic, morphological or compounds?
3. How do descriptive genitives differ from N + N sequences?

Possessive genetives expands nominals into noun phrases. Semantically, possessive genitives specify (in)definiteness and establish
reference within the NP. 
In Afaan Oromoo the head can be separately determined by definite article or by other reference tracking devices:
1a. -kitaaba Guyyoo
1b. -Kitaabicha Guyyoo  (*the Johon's book)

2a. -kitaaba namichaa 
2b. -kitaaba namichaa kana (*this the man's book)

Semantically, the possessor Guyyoo in (1a) functions like the definite article, specifying the referent of the NP. 
In this example Guyyoo specifiees whose book it is, namely Guyyoo's. From a cognitive-pragmatic and semantic point of view
the possessor can be viewed as an 'anchor' that narrows down the referent of the NP (Rosenbach, 2006:80). 

In Afaan Oromoo the possessor can be postmodified and can be headed by a final determiner (note that English possessor can be pre- as well as postmodified 
and can be headed by an initial determiner):
3a. kitaaba namicha guddaa [the big man]NP's book
3b. kitaaba namicha kaleessa argitee [the man you saw yesterday]NP's book

Genitive constructions in which the possessor functions as a determiner have NP status and they denote a specific
entity. In 'kitaaba namichaa' the noun 'kitaaba' is a specific book. 

In contrast the dependant in descriptive genitives in not an NP but usually a noun. 
4a. mana dhagaa
4b. *mana dhagichaa
4c. manicha dhagaa
In (4) the definite article -icha- can only belong to the head 'mana' and cannot belong the the dependant 'dhagaa'.
Therefore, the depandant is a nominal rather than a full NP in such cases can be seen from the ungrammaticality of 
(4b). This shows that the dependent cannot have a determiner of iss own. The final determiner goes with the head (and not
the dependent). Therefore descriptive genitives are themeselves not full NPs but nouns or nominals and, in contrast to
determine genitives, they denote properties and not specific entities. 

Semantically, the dependent in descriptive genitives contributes to the denotation of the head noun, not specifying
in (4a) whose house it is (as in a corresponding determiner genitive) but rather what type of house. As such, the 
the dependant has a classifiying function in such genitives. As a classifier, the dependent is not referential and
does not refer to a specific referent. Not that in 'mana dhagaa' reference is not made to specific stone 'dhagaa' 
but to stone 'dhagaa' in general. 

The semantic difference between determiner genitives and descriptive genitives as discussed above are reflected in 
different positions in Afaan Oromoo noun phrases. Word order in the noun phrase is iconically determined in that any element contributing 
to the denotation of the head noun is positioned adjacent to the head, while anything contributing to the reference
of the noun phrase will be most distantly located away from the head noun (p,81). 

5a. hoolaa foonii
5b. *hoolaa foonichaa
5c. hoolaa namicha sanaa 
5d. hoolaa adii namicha sanaa
(5a) shows word order of descriptive genitives. As shown in (5b) descriptive genitives prohibit the expansion, prefer
the dependant to be adjacent to the head. (5c) shows determiner genitives which allows expansion of the noun phrase.
In (5c) the determiner -icha and the 'sana' are added to the noun 'nama' which specifies sheep 'hoolaa'. Further, 
the adjective 'adii' is inserted between the possessor and the head noun to expand the noun phrase to (5d) is determiner 
genitive construction.(p,82).

A descriptive genitive can be classifying, metaphorical, and generic one. It specifies another noun. 
6. Digrii Lammaffaa
7. Gulantaa lammaffaa
8. Itti aanaa Ministeeraa


ARE DESCRIPTIVE GENITIVES SYNTACTIC PHRASES OR COMPOUNDS?

(a) Coordination test

Rosenbach, A. (2006: 83) gives three criterion to test if descriptive possessors are syntactic or cmpound. 
First criterion is Coornation test. In Afaan Oromoo, coordination of dependant is common with descriptive genitives. 
9a. foon hoolaa
9b. foon reettii
9c. foon hoolaafi reettii
10a. mana dhagaa
10b. mana mukaa
10c. dhagaa manaa
10d. dhagaafi muka manaa
11a. reettii foonii
11b. hoolaa foonii
11c. reettiifi hoolaa foonii
12a. hoolaa hormaataa
12b. reetti hormaataa
12c. reettiifi hoolaa hormaataa


Because compounds do not allow a third element to be inserted between theme, these examples indicte taht descriptive genitives are syntactic phrases and not compounds. 

(b) Modification of the dependent

If an N + N construction is a compound, then it should not be possible to separtely modify the first noun. 

13a. foon hoolaa
13b. foon hoolichaa


In fact it should be noted that the dependent in descriptive genitives gives a different interpretation after modification.
In hoolaa'sheep' is not a determiner, it expresses a type, not specifying foon 'meat'. 

(c) Modification of the head

As Rosenbach, A. (2006: 85) says, the strongest test for phrasehood is the ability of a modifier to intervene between
the dependent and the head noun as shown below:
14a. foon hoolaa
14b. foonicha hoolaa
15a. boojjitoo marqaa
15b. boojjitoowwan marqaa

As shown above -icha and -oowwan are added to the head by intervening between the dependent and the head noun
to rule out compound status. 

HOW DO DESCRIPTIVE GENITIVES DIFFER FROM N + N SEQUENCES? (p, 89) (there is no N + N) in Afaan Oromoo

Descriptive genitives shown so far are known as classifying genitives. These genitives are said to be the prototypical cases 
Rosenbach, A. (2006: 91). 

3. TYPES OF DESCRIPTIVE GENITIVES

Rosenbach, A. (2006: 92) argues there are three different of functions of descriptive genitives: classifying, metaphorical and generic ones. 
Classifying genitives are the ones usually referred to in the literature as 'descriptive genitives' (p, 92). These genitives
are used to name certain objects and they can convey various degrees of lexicalization, from completely oqpaque expressions
to fully semantically transparent ones (p, 92). 
16a. ija bunaa
16b. gumaa garbuu
16c. arraba ibiddaa
16d. guyyaa dubartootaa, Seera Makkoo Billii, 
(it includes, idiomatic expressions, plant names, insect names, named after person (p, 92). Product names, others
: girl's school, writers block, spider's web ...etc (p, 93)

In this naming function descriptive genitives are those that most clearly correspond to the term 'classifying genitives' as their basic
function is type restriction. However, thhis only holds for semantically endocentric cases, where the dependent 
clearly restricts the denotation of the head noun. In these cases the meaning of the head is the meaning of the 
whole genitive NP, i.e. St Valentine's day designates a certain day, women's undrwea a certain type of underwear
and smoker's cough a certain typeof cough, while a baby's head is not a type of head but a steak and kidney pudding.
Similarly in (33d) the meaning of the whole genitive construction is not deducible compositionally from the meaning of the 
head and the dependent attribute.. Rather, in these cases teh descriptive genitive refers to a complete mess (dog's breakfast) or to a specific type of balcony 
(widow's walks). While they are not as such transparent, knowledge of the etymology of these idiomatic expressions makes them fully
compositional in the figurative world, so to speak. For example, the term widow's walks (for porches on the roof)
goes back to the fact (or rather legend?) that the wives of seafarers used to to climb up there to watch out for the 
return of their husbands. Note, however, that even in the transparent cases (33e-g) the meaning of calassifying genives
is much more restrictive than in a corresponding determiner genitive. Electrician's tape, for example, describes a specific
type of tape, while a corresponding deterinmer genitive ([the elecrician's]tape) could mean various things: the 
tape the electrician possesses, uses, wants to have, dreams of, or whatever. It is in the nature of possession to allow
for all these meanings. As the function of the classifying genitives in (33) is to uniquely designate a specific object, it is 
clear that not all these possessive  meanings carry over and taht , so to speak, one possessive meaning gets 'frozen' in these cases. 
It is this 'freezing' of meaning which makes them so prone to undergo lexicalization and acquire lexeme  status. It is 
presumably for this reason that Huddleston & Pullum (2002: 470) regard this type fo genitive as 
'a somewhat unproductive category'. They note, for example, taht while we can have a summer's day and a winter's day,
a spring's day or an autumn's day are very questinable (they mark the latter two with a?). It is tru that the last two expressions are far less common than
the first two. (p, 93). 

As shown in the above examples (11) describes second degree, (12)  grade and (13) position.
